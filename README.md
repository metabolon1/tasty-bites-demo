## Files in this repo
- _Full_Report.ipynb_: a Jupyter notebook containing the full project report, including R code and figures. I submitted this file to DataCamp as part of my certification.
- _Full_Report.pdf_: the above file, printed as a PDF.
- _Summary_Report.md_: an abridged version of the full report.
- _Images\_: a directory containing figures used in Summary_Report.md.

## Note about dataset
The fictitious dataset used for this project is not included in this repo, because it is proprietary to DataCamp. However, descriptions of the dataset can be found in the report files.
